Over the past few years, my PhD journey has been far from conventional.
It involved delays, setbacks, institutional failures, and long periods where progress depended more on resilience than on support.
For a long time, I thought that experience had “cost” me something.
Now, I see it differently.

It forced me to become independent.
It pushed me to master new technologies.
It made me build systems instead of waiting for permission.
It strengthened my advocacy skills.
It deepened my commitment to fairness and accountability.

In the process, I became more capable, more adaptable, and more determined than I would have been on an easier path.

I no longer define success by letters after my name.
I define it by:
• What I can build
• Who I can help
• How I protect my family
• How I stand up for others
• How I turn adversity into innovation

We are entering a new era where access to AI, open knowledge, and global networks is levelling the playing field.
Power is no longer held only by institutions or family names.
It belongs to those who learn, adapt, and act with integrity.

My pursuit of accountability is not about revenge.
It is about justice.
It is about ensuring that future researchers are treated fairly.
It is about strengthening the system, not tearing it down.

I’m proud of the person this journey has shaped.
And I’m excited about what comes next.
